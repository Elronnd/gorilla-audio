Gorilla audio natively supports the OGG Vorbis and Opus formats.  You should
use these for all your high-quality lossy audio format needs.  MP3 is an
obsolete technology that requires large file sizes and produces low-quality
audio, and should be avoided.  However, if you really need mp3 support for some
reason, include 'mp3dec.c' and 'dr_mp3.h' in your source distribution and call
ga_contrib_sample_source_create_mp3 to create MP3 decoders from data sources.
