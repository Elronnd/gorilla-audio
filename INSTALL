Gorilla Audio should run on most systems with a c11-conformant compiler.  (It
will also run with minimal modification on systems with only a c99 compiler;
contact me if this is something you need.)  Windows support is only cursory at
the moment--patches welcome!--but the library should work under mingw.

To compile, simply run 'make' (or 'make MODE=release' to build with
optimizations).  This will generate o/(debug|release)/libgorilla.{a,so} which
you can link into your projects as needed.  You may need to substitute 'gmake'
for 'make' on some systems, installing the former if necessary.

The build system is affected by various flags for which reasonable values are
automatically chosen, but which you can override.  To enable a flag, add
'FLAG=value' to your command line; for instance, 'make BUILD_STATIC=0'.
Flags:
