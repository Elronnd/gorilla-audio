Gorilla Audio is a library that can be used for playing real-time audio.
(It's possible that it can be used for other things too, but we don't know
 anything about that.)

It was originally written by Tim Ambrogi, engine programmer at Final Form
Games, and as such has a slight bias towards game development, but should still
be suitable for other real-time audio playing needs.

It aims to be easy to use, simple, and powerful.  Comparisons with several
other audio libraries are available in docs/htm/manual.htm.

Gorilla Audio is licensed under the MIT license.  It also includes code
licensed under the Xiph license, a similar, permissive license.
