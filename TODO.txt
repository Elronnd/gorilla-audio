ROAD MAP
---

COMPATIBILITY:
- Implement more platforms/devices:
  - WASAPI (Windows).  (Maybe also ASIO?)
  - CoreAudio (OSX/iOS)
  - OpenSL (Android 2.3+) or AAudio (8.0+)
    - https://github.com/google/oboe abstracts over the two
  - Jack
  - Webaudio + wasm build?

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Improve looping system
  - Make it queryable and/or specify a number of future loops to perform
  - Expose loop interface to generic SampleSource data structure
- Specifiable/queryable device format (partly done)
- Handle-group support (synchronized start/seek/pause/stop)
- Mono mixer
- 8-bit mixer
- Arbitrary mixer rate
- Opaque handles (ints)
- Push handles writeable from main thread into an internal buffer
- Support for enumerating devices

USABILITY:
- Doxygen comments for the API
- Glossary of terms
- Tutorial on how to get started (akin to the example code)
- Documentation on how to extend the systems
- Better error codes and reporting

DSP FILTERS:
- Create framework for apply DSP filters
- Implement support for common filters:
  - Reverb, compressor, distortion, echo, equalizer, flanger, gargle, chorus, high-pass, low-pass, wah-wah

LUXURY FEATURES:
- Input audio recording (recording devices + wrapping samplesource)
- Optimize mixer (fewer branches, SIMD)
- Tracker support (MOD/S3M/XM/IT)
- Surround sound (multi-channel) input and output formats
- Support for multiple ga_StreamManager threads
- AIFF support
- Network-streaming audio (OGG, MP3, ShoutCast, IceCast)
- Handle-locking for atomic groups of control commands

KNOWN BUGS:
- Seeking can currently cause a handle to have fewer samples than expected mid-mix (rare race condition, can cause stutter/desync)
