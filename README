# About this repo

This is my own personal fork of gorilla audio, for use in my game engine.  It
is based on github user swistakm's own fork of gorilla audio.  The documentation
is not up-to-date, and the interface *has* changed!  Use with caution.

Please see CHANGELOG.txt for more information.  All modifications prior to and
including 0.3.1 were made by the original gorilla audio developers.  0.3.2 was
made by swistakm.  Further modifications were made by me.


# Gorilla Audio

Gorilla Audio is an attempt to make a free, straightforward, cross-platform,
high-level software audio mixer that supports playback of both static and
streaming sounds. It is intended for video game development, but should
easily support many other real-time audio software applications.

The library is written in ANSI C, and is licensed under the MIT license.
It was written by Tim Ambrogi, engine programmer at Final Form Games.

Gorilla Audio code includes some other libraries that are licensed under terms
other than MIT. This includes code under the Xiph and LGPL licenses. Non-MIT
code in the repository is denoted by COPYING files.
